## This is a simple and lightweight ReactJS boilerplate with Webpack to build beautiful frontend with ReactJS.

I've used:
* [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/) - static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. I've used with a dev server to see a real time modification
* [Sass] - the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world (CSS with superpower :wink:).
